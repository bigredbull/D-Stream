# D-Stream
Implementation of the D-Stream clustering algorithm for use in MOA.

The D-Stream algorithm is described by Yixin Chen and Li Tu in their paper "Density-Based Clustering for Real-Time Stream Data" [2]. Please cite that paper if you use this code.

MOA (Massive Online Analysis) [1] is a Java-based, open source framework for data stream mining. More details can be found on its website (http://moa.cms.waikato.ac.nz/) and it can be found on GitHub as well (https://github.com/waikato/moa).
